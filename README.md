# Data Analytics

This repository includes course material for the MM1 Data Analytics class at the [HECTOR School of Engineering & Management](https://www.hectorschool.kit.edu/index.php).

## Objectives

This class is a one-day crash course seeking to introduce the basic principles of essential Python-based tools for data manipulation and data analytics. It does not require particular prerequisites.

You should get to know the most important methods for statistical learning and understand the fundamental workflow for data analysis and be able to 
* ingest/read,
* process,
* understand,
* evaluate,
* and visualize
a data set.

**Disclaimer: This material accompanies an interactive course. It can be used as-is, but its purpose is to allow recaps of the class and preparation for follow-up courses.**

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need to install Python 3 and Jupyter on your computer.

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install the Python environment. We have provided the appropriate `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. 

Otherwise, you can create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and install the dependencies specified in the given `requirements.txt`.
